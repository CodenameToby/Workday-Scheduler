# Workday-Scheduler
Day planner to help organize a busy day

### [Click for deployed page](https://codenametoby.github.io/Workday-Scheduler/)

## How it works
The planner will have the current day displayed at the top of a calender. 
The user will be able to add events to existing timeblocks for standard 9am - 5pm hours.
When the user clicks in a timeblock, they can enter information about the event.
That text will be saved in local storage and the events will persist when the apge is refreshed.
